## About

TBD

## üö¥ Usage

If you just want to play just head to our [web site](https://cards.busy.ovh/).
If instead you enjoy playing with code, or you want to give us a hand, keep
reading.

### üêë Prerequisites

1. Install [Clojure](https://clojure.org/), following [those instructions](https://purelyfunctional.tv/guide/how-to-install-clojure/).
2. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for `npm`).
3. Install [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/docs/download), for reverse proxy.
   * We recommend using the version from the official distribution.
   * Be careful to install Caddy v2.

### üõ†Ô∏è How to run it

```bash
# Needed only the first time
lein deps

# To build and start a web server, with hot-reload enabled.
# Afterwards, go to: http://localhost:8280/.
# However, this won't serve the API. Read below for how-to.
lein dev

# To build the Less files to CSS, use one of:
lein less auto # for live reload
lein less once
```

The instructions above are for the frontend only. If you want the full website,
i.e. with the API, you need to run the game server and serve it at `/api`.

To simplify this setup, there is a `Caddyfile` in this repository that comes
pre-configured. Just make sure to respect the ports explained in the file.

```bash
# To start the reverse proxy
caddy run --watch

# Or to start as a daemon
caddy start --watch
caddy stop
```

Then, go to http://localhost:42800/, where the API is now available at `/api`.

For more details, see [README.re-frame.md](./README.re-frame.md).
